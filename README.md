# health-Tweets
Background: I've used Textblob sentiment analysis and Matplotlib to illustrate the relationship between sentiment polarity and subjectivity. This was inspired by a piece of internal work, recreated using publicly available data. Because I discovered a fascinating relationship between sentiment polarity and subjectivity. 

## Things to have handy before you start: 
If you have a Twitter developer account, make sure you have those details handy. If you don't have a Twitter developer account, you need one to access the Twitter API. Getting access approved can take a few days. It's also why I've included the sample datasets below. ðŸ‘‡

There are 2 sample datasets included in the repo: 
- one if you want to skip accessing the Twitter API and are happy using the existing 20,000 Tweets with keyword 'health' from February 2020
- another includes the polarity and subjectivity scores for said Tweets, ready for visualisation

Have fun! ðŸ™‚
